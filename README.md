## Ranking System

Player rankings are determined as follows:

1. Players who went out during the game receive the lowest ranks (ordered by elimination time)
2. Players who remained active until the end are ranked by **income**
   - Income = Final chips - Total rebuy amount
   - Higher income results in higher ranking
